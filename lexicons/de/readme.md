# German

**Warning**: This is an adaptation of someone who is not fluent in German, in tests using a translator the sentiment analysis makes sense, but as I am not proficient in the language, there are certainly inconsistencies in this lexicon. Review and further testing would be recommended !!

The lexicon is created based on [GerVADER](https://github.com/KarstenAMF/GerVADER) (A german adaptation of the sentiment classification tool VADER).
